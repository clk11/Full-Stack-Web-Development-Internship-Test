# Getting Started

To start the application, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Database Credentials:**
   - Navigate to the server folder.
   - Locate the `.env` file and add the necessary credentials for the database connection. (Credentials have been removed for security reasons.)
   > Note: There are two `.env` files involved. One is for the UI, as I'm using Vite, and the other is for the server, following the conventional setup.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the Project:**
   - Execute the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
